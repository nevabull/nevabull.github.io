     This site is a work in progress. A living journal of ideas that constantly changes.
     <br/>
     <br/> 
     <p>about me:</p>
     <p>I'm passionate about an odd collection of things; 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Aviation:
          <p> I spent the first half of my life flying anything I could. What is possible to fly is defined in dollars. 
            I didn't have many dollars, so I mainly flew hang gliders.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Science:
          <p>
            I did a science degree because it looked interesting. I chose a psychology major because there was some chance of getting a job at the end. There was a ton of neuroscience subjects in the psych degree and I really liked them.               
          </p>
          <p>
           I took a scholarship to study a graduate degree in neurophysiology because it was enough money to buy a new hang glider and I liked neurophysiology. 
           After that, I started a PhD in neurophsyiology (stabbing cells with electrodes, putting chemicals on them and watching what they do), 
           but after a few years of this, I realised that a) I didn't like experimenting with animals, b) not a huge job market and c) I'm not great at chemistry (you need a really deep understanding of organic chemistry to actually good at phsyiology).
          </p>
          <p>As I needed the scholarship to keep flying, I moved back to psychology and did a PhD in visual psychophysics ( Trying to figure out how the brain works by showing people animations on a computer and ask them to press buttons when they see stuff ). 
            This had even less job prospects, but it meant experimenting on human volunteers and running experiments that required creation of software, rather than chemistry.</p>
        <p>
          I took a research assistant job at the cardiology unit of the local hospital during the PhD. 
          I then moved into doing vascular and cardiac ultrasound, found that a bit boring and so focused more on migrating the departments information systems away from DOS (Not Kidding!). 
          During this time I did some research in cardiology. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Computational Neuroscience:
          <p>
            This has been a long standing hobby.  I'm unreasonably curious about how cells encode and process information. 
            </p><p> 
            I remember being amazed by the single cell recording work done in the 60's by Hubel and Weisel that lead to their theory of center surround receptive fields. 
            Then, when learning neurophysiology I came across a bit of software that simulated an action potential.  
            Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley won the Nobel prize for producing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model">mathematical model</a> that describes the action potential. 
            They did this in the 1940's and I was told that they had to spend weeks with the slide rule to calculate a single action potential in order to show it produced results like those recorded from nature. 
            Now it could be simulated instantly with the labs shiny new IBM XT 286. It got me thinking...  
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

       I've been tinkering with simulations of cellular networks for 20 yrs.  I've melted a few computers trying. These days workstations have become powerful enough to do a reasonable job of it.
       I'm using this web page to gradually document my simulation of information processing by large numbers of cells.
      You can see how it is coming along <a href="./vis.html">here</a>

        This interest in Compuational Nueroscience makes it's impossible to ignore the field of machine learning. It's an attempt by us to mimic us. 
        It's getting creepily good and has solved problems that seemed 'too hard' just 30yrs ago - like object recognition. So, I've been stalking the machine learning field for a long time.
        Recently Microsoft have released a great tool for mortals like me to use modern advanced machine learning techniques for your own projects. This is <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet">ML.NET</a>. 
        It's for C# and that's my favourite language, so I put together a basic tutorial for how to solve a silly problem with machine learning.  You can find it <a href="./ml1.html">here</a>.

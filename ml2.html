    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>If you are a developer, when you think of types of variables, you probably think of things like: int, long, bool, object etc.  
        In statistics, which is fundamental to ML, variables are thought of more in terms of whether they are:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous: 
                <p>A number where the size of the number has relative meaning. For example height, 186cm tall is taller than 185.99cm.</p></li>
            <p>Discreet variables are similar to continuous, but there are finite possabilities. This means they can be counted. For example, number of people with heart disease.</p>           
            <li>Categorical</li>
            <p>Nominal categorical variables are discreet, but it doesn't make sense to add them up. For example: names of colours could be: red, blue, green etc. 
                Categorical variables are often arbitarily coded into integers with something like red = 1, blue = 2 etc.
                It would make no sense in this case to take the average or sum of colours as the value of the integers used for coding have no relative meaning</p>
            <p>Ordinal categorical variables are variables where the value of the category has relative meaning, e.g, weight could be categorised as: underweight = 1, normal = 2, overweight = 3 or obese = 4.</p>
        </ul>
<br/>  
     <p>For ML, generally we need to get all our variables into one vector of float. 
        For that we do some transforms like normalising continuous, discreet and ordinal variables and One Hot Encoding nominal variables.</p>
        <p>Normalisation is just transforming the variable into a float so that the maximum value becomes 1 and the minimum becomes 0</p>
        <p>One Hot Encoding, splits a single variable into seperate boolean variables for each category: 
            for example, if you have a variable for colour with values of red, green or blue it will become three variables of bool (one for each colour with values of only 0 or 1).</p>
       <h4>Data Structure</h4>
       <p>For categorization tasks where you have a lot of examples of things (i.e. individual horses) and you want to predict some feature of them (i.e. winner or looser) 
        you need to have the data structured such that <em><strong>1 row is 1 example.</strong></em> It's a good idea to have this in mind when you collect your data.</p>
